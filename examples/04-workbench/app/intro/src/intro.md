# Shrub

This example project demonstrates using Shrub for both front-end and back-end development. The core of Shrub is intended to be lightweight and not tied to other frameworks or libraries. Shrub provides a few modules making it easier to integrate with some well known libraries such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), but these packages are not required.
